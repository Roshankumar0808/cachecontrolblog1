          <h1>Introduction: Cache-control</h1>
          <h3>Nowadays Cache control is the only best way through which we can dictate our browser to go to a certain server and catch or take the required data according to our need.
              Without cache control user exprience of browsing some browser will decline a lot as it will take an immense amount of time for some browser to get the same data again and again when we call it.
              So to overcome these issues devlopers introduced the concept of cache-controlling,so let see what its all about. 

          </h3>
          <h1>What is Cache-control?</h1>
          <p class="content1">
              In layman language we can define catche control as: When first time a user request the browser to get some resources from some other websites then our browser go to that website do proper search and request hosted website to give that particular data and once our browser get that data then it stored this catched file in browser as cache file so when some other time the user request to get this same file then this whole process time can be saved and the user will experince fast browsing speed .
          </p>
          <h1>Let's Understand Browser Caching:</h1>
          <p class="content1"> Browser catching is basically a method by which our browser save the website contents to use that quickly and efficiently when user dicates to get the same content in nearby future.In practical this can also be seen, when we request our browser to get something very first time it take a bit of time to load that content but  when we ask for the same content in nearby future then if takes alot less time compared to the first time, Why this actually happens is due to its caching property when we call it for first time it loads and saves all heavy image files and text and stores it in our local system for certain amount of time knowns as (TTL) known as time to live period and if the user ask for the same file within this TTL period it loads with great speed and with a lot less latency which in overall leads to alot better and faster browsing experience. 

          </p>
          <h1>What is TTL?</h1>
          <p class="content1">
              Any browser does not store any file/cache for very long time there is a specified time limit of every browser until when they store these file for faster accesss and this time period itself is known as TTL(Time to live).Once this TTL period is over browser has to once again do the same long processs again so that it can extend its TTL period according to client need. In practical browsing also you can see this once you start visting a website regularly it loads really fast because its TTL is updated ,but if you visit some websire that you visited few months back that would probably take more time compared to the last one beacause browser has to do those thinks again to create a new TTL. 
          </p>
          <h1>What is HTTP Headers?</h1>
          <p class="content1">HTTP are set of parameter which have a lot of additional information about betwwen user and server.The www, itself works around HTTP which act as syntax of all communication between user and sever. According to different type of communication between client and server there are different types of headers which access them.</p>
          <br>
          <h3>HTTP header are categorized into </h3>
          <p class="content1">1) General Header</p>
          <p class="content1">2) Request Header</p>
          <p class="content1">3) Response Header</p>
          <p class="content1">4) Entity Header</p>
